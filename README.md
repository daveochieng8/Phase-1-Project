## Exploratory Data Analysis for Microsoft's New Movie Studio
## Overview

In this project, we will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to generate insights for Microsoft, 
helping them decide what type of films to create for their new movie studio. We will use various datasets 
related to movies, analyze trends, and provide actionable recommendations based on our findings.

## Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. 
They have decided to create a new movie studio but lack knowledge about creating movies. Our task is to explore 
what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office and translate those findings into actionable insights 
for Microsoft's new movie studio.

## Objectives

The objectives of this project are to:
1. Compare budget to profitability.
2. Identify the top-performing genres.
3. Assess profitability by genre.

There is a strong positive correlation between production budget and gross revenues for both domestic and worldwide, and between gross revenues and profits.

The genres with the tallest bars are the most profitable on a global scale. Animation, adventure and Sci-Fi have the tallest bars.
These genres generate the highest average worldwide profits.
### Conclusion and Recommendations
##### Conclusion:
The analysis reveals that certain genres consistently perform better both domestically and worldwide. Action, Science Fiction, and Adventure films generally generate the highest average revenues and profits. Furthermore, the analysis of different budget ranges reveals that mid-range to high-range budgets often result in the most profitable movies.

##### Recommendations:

**1. Prioritize Profitable Genres:** Concentrate your efforts and resources on developing films within the Action, Science Fiction, and Adventure genres, as the analysis indicates these genres consistently generate the highest profits.

**2. Strategic Budget Management:** When allocating budgets for film productions, aim for the mid range. This budget range has been shown to yield the highest profits. Steer clear of excessively high budgets unless the potential returns are projected to be remarkably high and well-justified.
